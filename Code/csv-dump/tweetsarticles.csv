Facebook requires that ads promoting financial services disclose lending and transaction terms in similarly clear manners. That’s according to the app stores’ terms and conditions, and Facebook’s Financial and Insurance Products and Services policy. But, as Fintech Business Weekly explains, “big tech’s policies have created a perverse incentive for lenders to become less transparent — marketing products as ‘free’ or ‘0% APR’ while driving revenue through ‘tips,’ ‘donations,’ and expedited funding fees. ”Financial services providers like LendUp, OppLoans, RISE Credit, and FigLoans, all of which serve high-credit-risk populations by clearly disclosing rates and fees upfront, are not in the app stores. But apps like The Dave App, which offers “0% interest and pay it back on payday” with default “tipping” rates of 10 percent, are advertised by Facebook and available in both app stores.",seersite.com,2021-04-05T10:27:00
4/5/21 17:46,"Over the last few months, Microsoft has been running an aggressive campaign throwing shade at Apple’s Macs. Now the latest ad from Microsoft takes shots at iPad Pro while touting the Surface Pro 7 as the “better choice” with the same strategy it’s been using. In parallel with Microsoft’s “Still a Better Choice” campaign, Intel has also put a lot of energy into its latest “Go PC” campaign this year that started back in February. It even hired Justin Long – the former “I’m a Mac” star to mock the M1 Macs last month. Awkwardly, Intel’s new CEO Pat Gelsinger called the company’s latest shots at Apple “competitive fun” while simultaneously hoping to win back Apple’s chip business. Now Microsoft is out with its newest “Surface Pro 7: Still the Better Choice” ad. Previously we saw the company pitch the Surface Pro 7 as a better option over the MacBook Pro. Now the new ad takes some shots at the iPad Pro in the same uninspired style as the previous ads. The short 30-second ad mocks the iPad Pro for not having a built-in kickstand, just having one USB-C port, the Magic Keyboard being heavy, not being a “full computer and a tablet” and costing more than the Surface Pro 7. In contrast, Microsoft says the “Surface Pro 7 has everything you need to do what you love.”",9to5mac.com,2021-04-05T17:46:00

2021-04-05T15:25:11-04:00,"First period 2021 earnings season for US-based companies unofficially starts in mid-April. The iPhone maker has not yet scheduled its fiscal second quarter earnings date, but it is likely that it will take place between April 27th and April 29th. Wall Street has started to weigh in on how they believe Apple will perform in the January-to-March quarter. Below is a summary of sell-side expectations, along with analysts’ consensus opinion on Apple stock. Strong growth expected:Among the 30 Wall Street experts tracked by Stock Rover, consensus expectation is for revenues in the March quarter to grow by an impressive 32% year-over-year (see first table below). Should the estimate be met, this will be Apple’s best quarter of sales in at least five years, if not much longer. The robust top-line results would be achieved, in part, due to easy comps. Fiscal second quarter of 2020 was marked by the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis, when the first lockdowns caused Apple stores to close in the US and abroad, and consumers pulled back on spending. In the March 2020 period, Apple’s revenues increased by less than 1%. But because Apple did not provide guidance for fiscal second quarter 2021, due to pandemic uncertainties, analyst estimates have been all over the place. For example, the most optimistic expert sees revenues growing 43%. The least optimistic believes in a much tamer 21% increase. On the bottom line, Apple’s earnings per share is projected to land just short of $1. If achieved, the EPS increase over fiscal 2020 levels would be a very respectable 53%. Earnings that grow faster than revenues largely suggest some margin expansion and share retirement as well. Wall Street on Apple Stock - Looking more broadly at recommendations and share price targets, Wall Street continues to have a very bullish view on Apple stock. The great majority of analysts sees Apple stock as a strong buy. The consensus price target is roughly $150 per share, which suggests nearly 20% upside to current levels. Following two years of 80%-plus returns, another round of double-digit gains would not be bad at all.",thestreet.com,2021-04-05T15:25:11-04:00
2021-04-05T13:43:18+0000,"Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at the company’s work in autonomous vehicles, following recent reports that the company is in renewed talks to develop its own car. “The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we’ll see what Apple does,” Cook said in an interview released Monday with Kara Swisher on the “Sway” podcast. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day. I’m not saying that one will not,” Cook added. When asked if Apple was working on a car itself or the technology within a car, Cook declined to comment. “We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that,” he said. Apple has long been expected to get into the auto business with its own vehicle or selling its technology to other car makers, and has made a number of moves indicating it planned to do so. Helping bolster its engineering ranks, the company acquired autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai in 2019. An autonomous vehicle could position the company against Tesla, which is rolling out its own self-driving features. In 2018, Apple hired back Doug Field, then Tesla’s senior vice president of engineering, to presumably work on self-driving cars. Apple has also brought in several other former Tesla employees, including former Tesla vice president of engineering Michael Schwekutsch, now senior director of engineering for the Special Projects Group at Apple. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had even said last year that he once tried to start talks to sell the company to Apple, but Cook declined to take a meeting. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built. I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space. So I have great appreciation for them,” Cook told Swisher. Most recently, CNBC reported that Apple was close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. However, the automakers later walked back on the claims.",cnbc.com,2021-04-05T13:43:18+0000

4/5/21 14:53,"Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) products always generate a lot of excitement, given the tech giant's accent on innovation and focus on design. The company is widely expected to unveil a radically re-designed iMac, its personal computer line-up, later this year. What Happened: The proposed new iteration of the iMac will come with a display larger than its currently largest screen size, MacRumors reported, citing credible Apple leaker L0vetodream. In a private tweet, the leaker reportedly said the new iMac's screen size is much bigger than the largest one. Cupertino now sells iMacs with 21.5-inch and 27-inch screen sizes. A Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested the new iMac models will likely have a design similar to Pro Display XDR monitor, Apple's stand-alone high-end monitor with a 32-inch display. It will have slimmed down thick black borders around the screen and no sizable metal chin area, the report said. More importantly, the new iMacs will be powered by Apple's M1 chips, replacing Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) silicon found in the current models. Why It's Important: The iMac forms a core part of Apple's portfolio, and has been the second biggest revenue earner among its products. IMac sales totaled $8.68 billion in the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2020, representing a 21.2% year-over-year growth. The update is the first major overhaul since 2012, making it important for Apple to increase volume sales.

2021-04-05T12:06:18-04:00,"Tim Cook has been with Apple Inc. for 23 years and served as its chief executive officer for nearly a decade, but he used a new podcast appearance to suggest that some kind of an eventual change may be on the horizon. “I feel great right now. And the date’s not in sight,” the 60-year-old told the New York Times “Sway” podcast that was released Monday. “But 10 more years is a long time and probably not 10 more years. ”The interview touched on a wide range of topics including the controversial Parler social media app that was blocked by Apple earlier this year, Apple TV+ and autonomous vehicles. Cook, when asked about Elon Musk’s claim that he once tried to hold talks about the possibility of selling Tesla to Apple, said that he’s never spoken with Musk but that he has “great admiration and respect” for the company he built. “I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space,” Cook said without revealing many clues about what Apple had planned for the sector. “We’ll see what Apple does.

2021-04-05T09:27:22-04:00,"Apple CEO Tim Cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about Apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview with Kara Swisher for The New York Times this morning. When it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with Swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to Apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations. “You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” Cook said. He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.” “YOU KNOW, I’VE NEVER SPOKEN TO ELON.” Apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested a mixed reality device could launch next year. Augmented reality features are already available on the iPhone and iPad, but outside of some fun Snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet. Cook also talked broadly about Apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. Leaks from Apple have made it unclear if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if Apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. Cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition. “We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” Cook said. “And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.” Cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. But he warned that not every Apple project eventually ships. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day,” Cook said. “I’m not saying that one will not.” Swisher also asked Cook about Elon Musk’s comments about a failed attempt to discuss selling Tesla to Apple around 2017. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon,” Cook said, “although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”",theverge.com,2021-04-05T09:27:22-04:00
4/5/21 17:42,"The ballot-counting process in a closely watched union election by thousands of Amazon.com Inc. workers in Bessemer, Ala., continued Monday, with an outcome possible this week. The National Labor Relations Board has been going through mail-in ballots since March 30, the day after the voting period ended. As the count has proceeded, Amazon has sought to highlight its $15-an-hour pay and benefits, even as the company has come under fire from critics over its working conditions and tax payments. The company apologized Friday for a tweet published on March 24 by its news account that incorrectly challenged accounts of workers having to at times urinate in bottles because of Amazon's demanding schedule to deliver packages. The company said that while warehouse employees are able to use the restroom when needed, ""we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes."" As the voting process ended, Amazon began to defend itself on Twitter over its wages and other matters. Twitter Inc. last week also permanently suspended several accounts that had purported to be Amazon warehouse employees, according to a Twitter spokesman. The accounts had resembled those of ""FC Ambassadors,"" warehouse workers which Amazon has enlisted to post about the company on social media, including with comments that often defend it or speak positively about working conditions. Amazon said it didn't have any connections to the fake accounts. The election in Bessemer will determine whether the warehouse employees will become the first group to unionize among Amazon's roughly 950,000 U.S. workers. Pro-union employees have sought help from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, a frequent Amazon opponent that would represent the workers if they vote in favor of unionizing. Organizers have said that forming a union would allow workers to collectively bargain over safety standards, training, breaks, pay and other benefits. Those topics have been at the center of disputes between Amazon and its workforce sprawled across hundreds of facilities. Some employees have complained about what they say is a grueling workload and how the company monitors employees through an internal tracking system and cameras. Amazon has said that it offers some of the best pay and benefits available for comparable jobs in similar industries, and that the company provides a competitive compensation package that includes 401(k) and healthcare coverage. The company is on pace -- based on recent hiring trends -- to overtake Walmart Inc. as the largest U.S. employer within a few years. Here is what you need to know about the coming election results: When will election results be revealed? Results could come this week. The count has taken days because of the number of ballots and because both parties can dispute votes. The NLRB would recognize the union, if it receives a majority of votes. The board is used to typically gathering results from a single-day, in-person election, but the Covid-19 pandemic drove the election to be held by mail, extending the process. The counting process started on March 30. Names of voters are being read during a private session, and the NLRB is setting aside challenged ballots. Next, reporters will be allowed through a videoconference to tune in when the NLRB begins to count the yes or no votes of the unchallenged ballots. The timing of the final outcome is unclear. The NLRB is expected to announce results at the end of the count. The outcome could be affected if the challenged ballots exceed the margin of victory. In that scenario, the NLRB could hold a hearing to sort out the disputed votes. Each side could also contest the outcome of the election and file actions accusing the other of violating election standards, further delaying the final outcome. Why has this election received so much attention? Amazon, already one of the country's most powerful companies before the pandemic, has grown substantially in the past year. Amazon made $386.1 billion in sales in 2020 and saw its share price rise about 76%. Union supporters say the company's success, when weighed against the working conditions of its hourly workers, represents a symbol of the overbearing power of big tech companies and inequality plaguing America. President Biden and other high-profile figures have weighed in to support the Bessemer workers. The union battle has heightened emotions between company representatives and union supporters. Dave Clark, a senior Amazon executive, recently criticized independent Sen. Bernie Sanders's visit to Alabama on March 26 to meet with workers. Mr. Clark pointed out that the minimum wage in Vermont, which Mr. Sanders represents, is lower than Amazon's starting wage. Mr. Sanders said Amazon's wealth and success should enable the company to provide higher pay to its employees while easing some of its workplace policies. ""They know if you succeed here, it will spread all over this country,"" Mr. Sanders said of Amazon during his visit. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) has also publicly expressed support for the union, as have celebrities like Tina Fey and Danny Glover. Why did workers organize? RWDSU leaders have said they believe the coronavirus pandemic, together with the past year's civil-rights movements in America and tense political climate, has encouraged people to act. The union has touched on themes related to racial empowerment, as many of the employees at the Amazon warehouse are Black and have been involved in the Black Lives Matter movement. Labor experts say that unionizing in Bessemer could lead to similar efforts at other Amazon facilities. The company employs roughly 950,000 people in the U.S., most at its warehouses across the country. Regardless of the outcome in Bessemer, Amazon faces pressure from staff world-wide to make changes to its working conditions. Amazon employees outside of Alabama are gathering petition signatures, discussing potential strikes and consulting with unions about possible demands. The groups are seeking to alter company policies on the rate at which they must prepare packages as well as break time and shift schedules. Such issues are central for many employees amid Amazon's expansion and push to speed up delivery times. What will happen after the election? Ballots were mailed to roughly 6,000 employees. The majority of voters would have to support unionizing to be represented by the union. Amazon and the union battled for votes through varying employee outreach. Even if workers vote to unionize, it could take years of bargaining to reach a first contract between Amazon and the union. Either side could also contest the results of the election. Would a union change Amazon? Initially, not much. The company would have to start working toward a contract with Bessemer workers and worry about similar efforts popping up at other facilities. Eventually, it could push the company to alter its policies, such as break times or pay. Many employees have also long sought change to the rate at which they work, with employees typically having to fulfill hundreds of items per working hour, while the company monitors them closely. Amazon helped boost pay for low-wage workers in 2018 when it raised its hourly rate to $15 an hour, though it simultaneously did away with certain incentive pay and stock compensation. The company the next year committed to retraining one-third of its workforce, in part to help its employees move into more advanced jobs inside the company or find new careers outside of it. Amazon is in a favorable position to handle threats to its business. Roughly 40% of online sales are made on Amazon, according to market research firm eMarketer. The company's recent success has come up among some workers, who point to its profits and growth as a sign that Amazon could make changes to improve conditions. Why has Amazon opposed unionization? Many companies don't favor unions because it can limit flexibility and force them to negotiate on workplace issues that executives might want to set on their own terms. Although Amazon has dealt with labor unions among its employees in Europe for years, the company has opposed unionization attempts in the U.S. in the past. An effort backed by the RWDSU in 2018 to organize employees at Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market fizzled. About four years earlier, a small number of maintenance and repair technicians voted down a unionization attempt at a Middletown, Del., facility. During the Whole Foods campaign, Amazon used a training video to coach Whole Foods staff on how to spot organizing efforts. The company has said this video is no longer in use. And last year, Amazon posted -- and later removed -- job listings for analysts that included descriptions on monitoring labor-organizing threats. Amazon has said the postings weren't an accurate description of the roles and were made in error. How did each side campaign in the vote? Organizers set up a presence outside the 855,000-square-foot warehouse on an almost daily basis, talking to workers, handing them leaflets and calling them. The union also launched an information website and sought to garner support by rallying employees through family members and union members who work in other industries. Meanwhile, Amazon created a website -- DoItWithoutDues.com -- to encourage workers to vote against unionizing. Signs were posted around the facility, and managers initially held frequent meetings there with workers. A central focus of the company's message revolves around the cost of union dues. Amazon has argued that a union is unnecessary because its workers receive better pay and benefits from the company than they would in other comparable jobs. Amazon hasn't made as clear to workers, however, that Alabama is a so-called ""right to work"" state, meaning employees would have an option on whether to be union members and pay dues.",,2021-04-05T17:42:00

2021-04-05T19:20:08.162Z,"Amazon.com has explored opening discount retail stores selling a mix of home goods and electronics, a potentially significant expansion of the company’s growing portfolio of brick-and-mortar locations. The outlets would carry unsold inventory sitting in Amazon’s warehouses at steep discounts, according to two people familiar with the plans. The company has considered opening permanent stores, as well as pop-up locations in malls or parking lots, said the people. The plans were preliminary and under discussion last year, but the pandemic and new Fresh grocery chain forced many employees to focus on day-to-day operations. “It’s a way to be able to clean out warehouses, and get through inventory without having to destroy it,” said one of the people, who was briefed on the plans but not authorized to discuss them. “It is keeping with the value proposition of Amazon, keeping price at the forefront and allowing customers to get access to products at low cost.” Amazon declined to comment. In its hunt for further growth after reaching a commanding position in many categories of online retail, Amazon has built a sizable brick-and-mortar operation in the last several years, beginning with a chain of bookstores, which debuted in 2015 at an upscale Seattle mall. Amazon Go, a cashierless convenience store that uses cameras and other sensors to track what shoppers take off the shelf, opened to the public in 2018.

2021-04-04T09:51:00Z,"It's pretty hard for investors to go wrong when you're buying into the most dominant retail platform in the world's No. 1 economy, which happens to be dependent on consumption. According to a March 2020 report from eMarketer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was expected to pick up another 100 basis points of U.S. online retail market share in 2021. If accurate, this'll mean that roughly $0.40 of every $1 spent online in the U.S. will be routed through Amazon. The company's sheer dominance online has helped it attract well over 150 million Prime users. The fees Amazon collects from Prime help it to undercut brick-and-mortar stores on price. Furthermore, Prime users spend many times more each year than non-Prime customers, and they're more inclined to stay within Amazon's ecosystem of products and services. Although retail margins are often minimal, Amazon also has its cloud infrastructure service segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to lean on. AWS grew sales by 30% in 2020 (that is, during the worst economic downturn in decades), and it's shown little sign of slowing down.
