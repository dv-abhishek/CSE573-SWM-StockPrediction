Download the Processed CSV and pickle files from:

Note: Only pickle files are necessary. CSV files are only for reference.

Update from Naveen: I have added one gram features extraction code for both amazon and apple. 
If you just run the 'n-gram-feature-extraction.ipynb' notebook in your local, it would generate the pickle files for features for respective company. That would hardly take 5 mins.

In your local, please directly use the files put up by Abhishek in drive as it takes lots of time in preprocessing.  

Update from Mounavi:
I am adding the link for google collab which contains the code to obtain the tweets data related to stocks of AMZN and AAPL.
